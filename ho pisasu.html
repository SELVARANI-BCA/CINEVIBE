            <p>Pisasu (2014) is a Tamil supernatural thriller directed by Mysskin. The story begins with a violinist, Siddharth (played by Naga), who tries to save a young girl, Bhavani (Prayaga Martin), after a road accident. Tragically, she dies in his arms. Soon after, Siddharth experiences eerie paranormal activities in his house and realizes that Bhavani's ghost is haunting him. However, the twist lies in the ghost's intentionsâ€”it appears to guide Siddharth to uncover the truth about her death and bring her killers to justice.

                The movie is known for Mysskin's unique storytelling style, blending horror with emotional depth. The cinematography by Ravi Roy and the haunting music by Arrol Corelli, including the track "Pogum Paadhai," add to its eerie yet poignant atmosphere. Pisasu received critical acclaim for its innovative take on the horror genre, focusing more on human emotions than typical horror tropes</p>
