            <p>Aagadu (2014) is a Telugu-language action-comedy film directed by Srinu Vaitla and starring Mahesh Babu in the lead role. The film also features Tamannaah, Rajendra Prasad, Sonu Sood, and Sampath Raj in pivotal roles.

                The story follows Shankar (played by Mahesh Babu), a tough, fearless police officer who is transferred to a small town to tackle a notorious gang involved in illegal activities. Shankarâ€™s primary mission is to rid the town of corruption and crime, but his journey is complicated by personal and emotional factors. His actions are often comedic, as he uses unconventional methods to fight the criminals, while also dealing with a romantic angle with the character Saraswati (played by Tamannaah).
