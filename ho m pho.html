            <p>The Malayalam movie Phoenix (2023), directed by Vishnu Bharathan and written by Midhun Manuel Thomas, blends a tragic love story with horror elements. Set in the 1990s, the plot follows Advocate John Williams and his family as they move into a house near the beach, only to encounter the haunting spirit of Rose. Rose's ghost, rooted in an unfulfilled love for Freddy, adds an emotional layer to the eerie events. The story also intertwines with a cholera outbreak, creating a tense and layered narrative.

                The film, praised for its unique approach to the horror genre, relies less on jump scares and more on emotional depth and atmospheric tension. Performances, particularly by Aju Varghese as John Williams and Abhirami Bose as Rose, have been highly appreciated. The movie explores themes of love, loss, and longing while maintaining a compelling horror narrative. It premiered on November 17, 2023, and is available on Amazon Prime Video</p>
