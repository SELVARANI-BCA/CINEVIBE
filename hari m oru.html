            <p>Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha is a 1989 Indian Malayalam-language epic historical drama film directed by Hariharan and written by M.T. Vasudevan Nair. The film stars Mammootty in the lead role of Chandu, a legendary warrior from North Kerala, and it is based on the folk tales surrounding his character.

                The film tells the story of Chandu, a brave and skilled warrior who becomes infamous for his role in a series of conflicts and betrayals. It presents a complex narrative of honor, revenge, and personal tragedy. The story, set in the medieval period, explores Chanduâ€™s life through the eyes of different characters, particularly his internal struggles and moral dilemmas. While initially depicted as a hero and a loyal warrior, Chandu's journey takes a tragic turn as he becomes embroiled in personal vendettas, political intrigues, and a distorted sense of duty.
