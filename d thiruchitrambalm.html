            <p>Thiruchitrambalam is a 2022 Tamil-language romantic drama directed by Mithran R. Jawahar. The film stars Dhanush as Pazham, a simple delivery driver with a somewhat aimless life. He lives with his strict father, Inspector Neelakandan (played by Prakash Raj), with whom he has a strained relationship, and his grandfather, Thiruchitrambalam Sr. (played by Bharathiraja), who serves as a cheerful support in Pazham’s life.

                Pazham has a long-time friend, Shobana (played by Nithya Menen), who becomes his confidante as he navigates romantic interests and other life challenges. Despite his repeated romantic failures, Shobana is always there to offer him encouragement, leading to a heartwarming exploration of friendship and love. The film portrays Pazham’s journey of self-discovery and the gradual realization of what truly matters in his life.
