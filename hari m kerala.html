            <p>Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja is a 2009 Indian Malayalam-language historical epic film directed by T. Hariharan and written by C.G. Rajendra Babu. The film stars Mammootty in the titular role of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, the warrior king of the Pazhassi family, also known as the "Tiger of Kerala," who fought against the British East India Company in the 18th century.

                The story is set during the period of British colonization in India and chronicles the life and struggle of Pazhassi Raja. He is depicted as a brave and strategic leader who leads his people in rebellion against the British forces in the Wayanad region of Kerala. The film covers his resistance against British oppression, his tactical genius in guerrilla warfare, and the challenges he faces both from the British and his own people.
