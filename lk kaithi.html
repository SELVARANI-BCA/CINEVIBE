            <p>Kaithi (2019) is a gripping Tamil action-thriller directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. The film stars Karthi in the lead role as Dilli, a former prisoner who is forced to assist the police in a high-stakes mission on the night of his release. The story revolves around Dilli, who is asked to transport a batch of unconscious police officers to a hospital while they are being hunted by a dangerous criminal gang. The film unfolds in real-time, adding to the intensity and suspense, as Dilli races against time to save the officers and evade the gang.

                Kaithi is known for its edge-of-the-seat tension, as it delivers a fast-paced narrative with minimal subplots. Unlike typical commercial films, it is structured around a single night and focuses solely on action, creating a raw and immersive experience. The absence of songs, typical in Tamil cinema, adds to the film's realism and intensity, making it a refreshing departure from the norm.</p>
