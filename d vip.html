            <p style="height: 170px;">Velaiilla Pattadhari (VIP), also known as VIP, is a 2014 Tamil-language action-drama film written and directed by Velraj. The movie stars Dhanush as Raghuvaran, an unemployed engineering graduate struggling to find a job, and Amala Paul as Shalini, his supportive love interest.

                The film follows Raghuvaran’s journey as he faces the societal and familial pressures of unemployment. Despite being criticized by family members, he is determined to work in his field and is not willing to settle for jobs outside his engineering qualification. Raghuvaran’s life takes a turn when he gets a significant career opportunity, but it also brings new challenges, including a rivalry with a powerful construction magnate, played by Samuthirakani.
