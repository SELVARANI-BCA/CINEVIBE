            <p>“Aneethi” is a Tamil-language thriller directed by Vasanthabalan, featuring Arjun Das in the lead role. The film explores the life of Thiru (played by Arjun Das), a food delivery agent who grapples with his dark past and a growing sense of injustice. The narrative follows his struggles as he faces mistreatment in his workplace and an abusive environment, which leads to him developing violent tendencies. The story delves into themes of class disparity, power abuse, and the harsh realities of working-class life.

                Thiru's life takes a turn when he falls in love with Subbu, a domestic worker who is also subjected to mistreatment. The plot intensifies when an elderly woman, Mangayarkarasi, is found dead under mysterious circumstances, and Thiru and Subbu are falsely accused of the crime. As the story unfolds, Thiru's past trauma and violent urges come to the forefront, leading to a bloody and dramatic climax.
