            <p>Parayam is a 1993 Indian Malayalam-language drama film directed by P. G. Viswambharan and written by C.G. Rajendra Babu. The film stars Jayaram, Sreeja, Innocent, and Nedumudi Venu in significant roles.

                The story of Parayam revolves around a young man named Ravi (played by Jayaram), who comes from a poor family and struggles to make ends meet. He is caught in a web of emotional turmoil and social challenges. The central theme of the film revolves around Ravi's internal conflicts, family issues, and the societal pressures he faces while trying to build a better life.
                
                As the story progresses, Ravi's character grapples with questions of morality, relationships, and survival. The film explores themes such as sacrifice, love, and personal growth in a world that can often seem harsh and unyielding. The title Parayam (meaning "saying" or "message") symbolizes the central message that Ravi receives through his trials and his efforts to live with dignity.
