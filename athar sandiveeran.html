            <p>Sandiveeran is a 2015 Tamil-language rural drama directed by A. Sarkunam and produced by Bala. The film stars Vikram Prabhu as Sakthi, a young man from a rural village, and Sri Divya as Kavitha, his love interest. The story is set against the backdrop of caste tensions and feuds in rural Tamil Nadu.

                The plot follows Sakthi, who returns to his village and ends up getting involved in the long-standing caste-based conflicts in his community. His love for Kavitha, who belongs to an opposing group, complicates things further. The film explores themes of love, loyalty, and the complexities of caste issues, as Sakthi attempts to bring peace while facing opposition from both sides.
                
                The filmâ€™s music, composed by N. R. Raghunanthan, adds emotional depth to the intense narrative. Sandiveeran received attention for its raw portrayal of village life and the challenges stemming from deeply rooted social divides, though it received mixed reviews for its storyline.</p>
