            <p>Kalakalappu is a 2012 Tamil-language comedy film directed by Sundar C. The movie features Vimal, Shiva, Anjali, Oviya, and Santhanam, and was a commercial success. The story revolves around two brothers, Raghu (Vimal) and Seenu (Shiva), who travel to Chennai to start a business but end up losing all their money. To make ends meet, they start working at a local hotel owned by Sundarapandian (Vishakha Singh), which is struggling due to poor food and service. They, along with their friend Ganesh (Santhanam), devise a plan to save the business.

                The film's humor is largely slapstick, involving misunderstandings and mistaken identities, while the romantic subplots between Seenu and Maya (Anjali), and Raghu and Hema (Oviya) add to the chaos. It’s lighthearted and entertaining, with a few comedic twists and turns. Kalakalappu was praised for its fun and energetic performances, especially by Santhanam, and its catchy soundtrack​
