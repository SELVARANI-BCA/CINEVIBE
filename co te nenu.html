            <p>Nenu Local is a 2017 Telugu-language romantic action-comedy film directed by Trinadha Rao Nakkina, starring Nani and Keerthy Suresh in the lead roles. The film tells the story of a carefree and rebellious young man named Santosh (played by Nani), who is also known as "Local," due to his laid-back attitude and disinterest in following societal norms.

                Santosh is a fun-loving, independent guy who has little interest in traditional education or career paths. However, his life takes a turn when he meets Keerthy (played by Keerthy Suresh), a smart, strong-willed, and determined woman. Despite his carefree nature, Santosh falls deeply in love with her and tries to win her over, even though she is initially indifferent toward him.
                
                As the story progresses, Santoshâ€™s love for Keerthy faces various obstacles, particularly due to her father, a strict and powerful man, who disapproves of their relationship.
