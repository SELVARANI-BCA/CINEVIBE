            <p>Keeda Cola is a 2023 Telugu-language crime-comedy film directed by Sree Vardhan, starring a fresh cast of newcomers in lead roles. The film is set in the backdrop of a small town, where the central characters find themselves entangled in a series of comical yet dangerous events.

                The story revolves around two young men, who, due to their poor decision-making, get involved in a major criminal activity. They get caught in a complicated situation when they try to solve their financial problems and end up in a larger conspiracy. While the two characters initially have no connection to the criminal underworld, their lives spiral out of control when they accidentally become involved in a shady deal.
                
                Despite the serious nature of the crimes surrounding them, Keeda Cola is infused with humor and satire, highlighting the contrast between the characters' naive behavior and the dangerous world they inadvertently become part of.
