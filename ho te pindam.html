            <p>Pindam is a 2023 Telugu-language horror film directed by Sandeep Reddy, starring newcomers in the lead roles. The movie blends supernatural elements with suspense and drama, creating an eerie atmosphere throughout.

                The story revolves around a small rural village where strange and unexplained events begin to occur. The protagonist, a young man named Raghav (played by a debut actor), moves to the village with his family in search of a peaceful life. However, as they settle in, they begin to experience unsettling occurrences. Strange noises, ghostly apparitions, and other paranormal activities lead Raghav to investigate the dark history of the village.
                
                Through his investigation, Raghav uncovers a tragic story tied to the land and its past inhabitants, involving curses, revenge, and unresolved wrongs. As he digs deeper, he faces numerous challenges, both from the supernatural forces and from the skepticism of those around him.
