            <p>Uthamaputhiran is a 2010 Tamil-language romantic comedy-drama directed by Mithran Jawahar, starring Dhanush and Genelia D'Souza. The film is a remake of the Telugu movie Ready and is known for its humor, lively plot, and endearing performances.

                The story follows Siva (played by Dhanush), a cheerful and mischievous young man who inadvertently kidnaps Pooja (played by Genelia) instead of her cousin, setting off a series of comedic misunderstandings. Pooja, a spirited young woman, is on the run from her controlling family, who want her to marry against her will. Siva decides to help her, leading to a sequence of events where they encounter quirky family members, hidden agendas, and unexpected challenges. Over time, Siva and Pooja fall in love, and Siva navigates his way through a complex family dynamic to unite with her.
