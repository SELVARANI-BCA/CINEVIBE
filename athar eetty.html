            <p>Eetti is a 2015 Tamil sports action film directed by Ravi Arasu and stars Atharvaa Murali as Pugazh, a skilled athlete with a unique medical condition, and Sri Divya as Gayathri, his love interest. The story follows Pugazh, a national-level hurdler from a small town who dreams of a successful athletic career. However, he suffers from a rare bleeding disorder, which puts him at great risk, especially in high-contact sports.

                The film’s plot is driven by Pugazh’s determination to overcome his health condition and his interactions with Gayathri, who becomes his support system. At the same time, he faces challenges from corrupt individuals trying to exploit his athletic potential. Eetti combines sports, romance, and action, focusing on Pugazh's journey to achieve his dreams against all odds.
