            <p>Carbon is a 2018 Malayalam film directed by Vinu Vishwanath, starring Fahadh Faasil and Mamta Mohandas in lead roles. The film is set in the backdrop of a remote village in the forests of Wayanad and follows the story of a man named Kichu (played by Fahadh Faasil), a heavy machinery operator who gets involved in an illegal activity. Kichu is assigned the task of retrieving a valuable treasure buried deep within the forest. The film is a mix of action, thriller, and suspense, focusing on survival, human greed, and the challenges of nature.

                Carbon is known for its gritty portrayal of life in the forests, stunning cinematography, and intense performances. The film explores themes of isolation, morality, and the consequences of oneâ€™s actions in the wild. Despite being set in a rural and rustic environment, the film has a strong urban feel, driven by its complex characters and themes.</p>
