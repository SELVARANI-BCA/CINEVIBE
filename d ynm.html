            <p>Yaaradi Nee Mohini is a 2008 Tamil-language romantic drama directed by Mithran Jawahar and produced by R. K. Productions. The film stars Dhanush as Vasu, a young man struggling to find his purpose, and Nayanthara as Keerthi, a driven and ambitious woman who initially disapproves of Vasu’s carefree attitude.

                The story follows Vasu, an unemployed graduate living under the shadow of his strict father, who constantly berates him. Vasu’s life takes a hopeful turn when he sees Keerthi and falls in love. With determination, he transforms himself to win her approval, eventually finding a job in her company. Despite his efforts, Keerthi is already engaged to another man, sparking a bittersweet tale of love, sacrifice, and self-growth. As Vasu navigates his feelings, he also forms strong bonds with Keerthi's family, who help him discover his self-worth and his capacity for love beyond expectations.
