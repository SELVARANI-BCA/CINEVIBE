            <p>Bigil is a 2019 Tamil-language sports action drama directed by Atlee, starring Vijay in dual roles, alongside Nayanthara, Kathir, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, and Vijay Sethupathi. The film is a blend of sports, drama, and action, with a strong social message about women’s empowerment and overcoming societal obstacles.

                The story follows Michael (Vijay), a former football player who is forced to step into coaching a women’s football team after the tragic death of his close friend, Rayappan. Michael, under the alias of Bigil, battles not only the odds of managing an underperforming team but also his personal demons, including the legacy of his father's criminal activities. As the coach of the women's team, Michael pushes them to achieve greatness and proves that they deserve equal recognition in sports.
