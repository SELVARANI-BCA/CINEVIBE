            <p>Mersal is a 2017 Tamil-language action thriller film directed by Atlee, starring Vijay in a triple role, with Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Kajal Aggarwal, and Nithya Menen playing key roles. The film follows the story of Vijay's character, who seeks to avenge the wrongdoings in the medical industry, particularly targeting corrupt practices involving medical treatment and the exploitation of the poor.

                The narrative revolves around Vetri, a magician, who seeks to expose the dark side of the healthcare industry, while also discovering a hidden connection with his familyâ€™s tragic past. Alongside this, his alter ego, Thalapathy, emerges to fight against the exploitation of the common people.
                
                The film was widely appreciated for its strong social message about medical corruption and the importance of integrity. Atlee's direction, along with Vijay's powerful performance in multiple roles, helped the film become a huge commercial success.
