            <p>Avatharam is a 1998 Indian Malayalam-language fantasy drama film directed by Hariharan and written by C.G. Rajendra Babu. The film stars Mammootty in the lead role, supported by a talented cast including Suhasini, Innocent, M.G. Soman, and others.

                The story revolves around Shivadas, played by Mammootty, a man who is a recluse and lives in isolation in a remote village. He is a mystic figure with supernatural powers, and the film blends elements of spirituality, myth, and fantasy with social issues. The plot unfolds as Shivadas becomes entangled in the lives of the villagers, who initially view him with suspicion. Over time, the villagers begin to recognize his powers, and Shivadas becomes a symbol of hope and guidance for the community.
                
                The film explores themes of good versus evil, the struggle for justice, and the supernatural forces that influence human lives.
