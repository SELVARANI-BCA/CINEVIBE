            <p>Sargam is a 1992 Indian Malayalam-language drama film directed by Hariharan, written by C.G. Rajendra Babu, and starring Jayaram, Vineetha, and K.P.A.C. Lalitha. The film tells the story of a young man named Gopi, who has a passion for music but is constrained by his family's financial situation.

                The narrative revolves around his struggles to fulfill his dreams, especially his aspirations to become a singer. Gopi's journey is complicated by familial pressures, societal expectations, and his romantic entanglement with a woman named Rathi, played by Vineetha.
                
                The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of one's dreams against all odds. It is also noted for its soulful music, especially the famous song "Sargam," which became iconic in Malayalam cinema. The performances, particularly that of Jayaram, received widespread acclaim, and the film's heartwarming narrative resonated with audiences.
