            <p>Pattaas (2020) is a Telugu-language action drama film directed by R. S. Durai Senthilkumar and starring Dhanush in dual roles. The film also features Mehreen Pirzada as the female lead, along with Naren, Karunas, and others in key supporting roles.

                The story is set focusing on two generations of the same family. Dhanush plays the role of Raghunandan, a respected martial artist, who is known for his legendary skills in the traditional Silambam martial art. The first part of the film revolves around his character’s rise in the martial arts world, where he fights against a corrupt system that seeks to undermine traditional values.
                
                The second part of the story shifts to a modern-day setting, where Dhanush plays his grandson, Vetrimaaran, who is caught up in a conflict with a powerful antagonist. The film explores his journey as he uncovers the legacy of his grandfather’s martial arts prowess and confronts the challenges he faces in his own life.
